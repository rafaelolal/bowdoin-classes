1. Short tower solution for 15 blocks: 4 5 6 10 11 12 13

2. Time to solve for 20: 464; 21: 846; 22: 1827. These ever increasing times make sense because for an increase of 1 in n (number of blocks) there are 2^n more combinations to check. Thus, it makes sense that the times increase exponentially.

3. Time to solve for 50 blocks: 489357836288 milliseconds or 15.5 years.
